Software Engineering Process Models From slideshare.net
In software engineering, each program must meet the usability and technical criteria. Assess progress against the plan and take actions to maintain the schedule. 1) large software, 2) scalability 3) adaptability 4) cost and 5) dynamic nature. Software processes is a coherent set of activities for specifying, designing, implementing and testing software systems.
