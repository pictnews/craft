Structural Engineering, Graduate Certificate Find Your Degree UAB From uab.edu
Structural engineering is a fairly broad field, but there are a few commonly shared tasks. Structural engineers carry out design calculations and analysis of the architectural proposals to ensure the design works structurally to and ensure the safety of the building. A structural engineer works to balance various aspects of the project like safety to design. Their work takes account mainly of safety, technical, economic, and environmental concerns, but they may also consider aesthetic and social.
