<p>Compliance of blood vessels in short, compliance refers to the “ease” of the blood vessel, either artery or vein, to distend on the change of volume contained or pressure applied. It is the reciprocal of elastance, hence elastance is a measure of the tendency of a hollow organ to recoil toward its. The term compliance is used to describe how easily a chamber of the heart or the lumen of a blood vessel expands when it is filled with a volume of blood. The greater the blood vessel's compliance, the more it can expand to accommodate blood without increased resistance or blood pressure. Cardiovascular System MR. DODD WALDWICK HIGH SCHOOL.</p>

<p>When the volume and so the pressure highers in the blood vessel the vascualar wall will stretch. Compliance of blood vessels in short, compliance refers to the “ease” of the blood vessel, either artery or vein, to distend on the change of volume contained or pressure applied. Compliance, which is also known as capacitance or distensibility, is the ability of a vessel to respond to an increase in pressure by expanding or swelling and increasing the volume of blood it can hold, or to respond to a decrease in pressure by contracting and decreasing the volume of blood it can hold. This physically means that blood vessels with a higher compliance deform easier than lower compliance blood vessels under the same pressure and volume conditions.
