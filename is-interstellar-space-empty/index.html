30 Incredible iPhone Photos That Use Empty Space From iphonephotographyschool.com
Ready or not, it is time for its favored children to take the reins of their existence. The space between stars is known as interstellar space, and so the space between galaxies is called intergalactic space. There is likely, some space dust and/or occasional rocky/icy objects in between. Very dilute gas even in “empty” space.

<p>The space between stars is known as interstellar space, and so the space between galaxies is called intergalactic space. Typical densities in the interstellar medium are one particle per cubic centimeter. In empty, interstellar space, the temperature is just 3 kelvins, not much above absolute zero, which is the coldest anything can ever get.

<p>This space is also near absolute vacuum with matter being very diluted. Interstellar space has an average density of one atom per cubic centimetre, although there are regions with higher densities, like nebulas. I do not know what type of data or theories there is on this, but i would think that although that space is mostly empty, it is likely not completely empty.
