<p>17 facts about interstellar travel that will have you dreaming of space 1. From the beginning of the space age to the launch of the voyager spacecrafts — a span of just two decades —. Such a feat would be exceptionally difficult. For example, interplanetary travel within our own solar system is generally under 30 au or distances between the earth and sun.

<p>“the notion of sending humans to interstellar space is so far out in the sense that people need to have resources on the scale of a planet,” he said. It makes interstellar travel possible, or at least possible within human lifetimes. For example, interplanetary travel within our own solar system is generally under 30 au or distances between the earth and sun.

<p>People have a good reason to think this is still just a science fiction, it’s really hard to even imagine the distance we would need to travel. The distances between the planets in the solar system are typically measured in standard astronomical units (au)—whereas the distances between stars are typically hundreds of thousands of au, and usually. The nearest star to earth is out of reach using current technologies. Humans are fairly puny creatures, and we can’t stand much acceleration.
