<p>Nonexperimental designs include research designs in which an experimenter simply either describes a group or examines relationships between preexisting groups. Explanatory research design is used to further expand explore and explain the researchers ideas and theories. This experimental design is considered very weak, as the researcher has little control over the research. Quantitative research designs can be divided into two main categories: Causal or Experimental Research Designs.</p>
