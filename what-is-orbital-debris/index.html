Why space debris cleanup might be a national security threat From theconversation.com
It is pieces from spacecraft. It all began with the birth of the space age in 1957, when the ussr launched sputnik 1. The smaller pieces of orbital space debris now exceed the population of meteoroids in earth orbit and are becoming an increasing threat to orbiting spacecraft. Second, orbital debris terminology is more simply:
