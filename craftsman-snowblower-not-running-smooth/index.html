If the blower starts immediately, then you know that the plug was the problem. This belt connects the engine and gearbox. Since your craftsman snowblower has been sitting unused for the past several months, you may have trouble getting it to run because the gas might have developed a gummy residue. As soon as i switch it over to run it would stall.
