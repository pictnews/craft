<p>The polyglot microservices allow developers to pick a programming language of their choice in order to build products in more efficient ways. Most of them have an excellent level of the interoperability with the code written in the plain old java so it is really easy to take the polyglot microservices route. The essence of a polyglot architecture is to delegate the decision over which technology stack and programming languages to use to the service developers. By providing polyglot persistence as a service, developers can focus on building great applications and not worry. Reverse Side of All Microservices Architecture Benefits.</p>

<p>Programming in many languages, known as polyglot programming, is the foundation of polyglot microservices built on this principle. Rather, microservices applications let you build and manage each service independent of another service. Polyglot programming is the practice of writing code in multiple languages to capture additional functionality and efficiency not available in a single language. Different services use different versions of the same. Why should you use microservices and containers? IBM Developer.</p>
