A design is a governing plan or approach by which various parts of an artwork are created and assembled. Therefore, a structure cannot exist a successful piece of work of structural fine art without too being a successful work of structural technology blueprint, yet many works of structural engineering design that are safe and serviceable exercise not rise to the level of structural art because they fail to exist economical, efficient, or elegant. It began in linguistics with the work of ferdinand de saussure. The elements of design are the physical parts of the artwork, or the form.
