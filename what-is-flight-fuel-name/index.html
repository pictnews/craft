<p>Different terms or names for the same concept are often used interchangeably by different regulatory authorities or flight planning organizations. With the exception of coleman fuel, all commonly available fuels from petrol stations and supermarkets are blended mixtures that vary in composition depending on the brand, the country and even the time of year (winter/summer). Ice crystals mixed with fuel can accumulate in fuel filters, impeding fuel flow causing fuel starvation during flight. The latter is also the fuel of choice for the us air force and therefore generally reserved for those operations. Fuel Tank Safety (Phase 2) Compliance Training Aviation Courses.</p>
