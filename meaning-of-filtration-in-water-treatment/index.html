Once the floc has settled to the bottom of the water supply, the clear water on top will pass through filters of varying compositions (sand, gravel, and charcoal) and pore sizes, in order to remove dissolved particles, such as dust, parasites, bacteria, viruses, and chemicals. The method employs an interposing medium through which only the water can pass leaving behind the contaminants. Filtration is a treatment process that is used to accomplish this goal, either by providing a. Drinking water treatment solutions at different levels:
