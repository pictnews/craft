Types of matrices and reinforcements in composites. Each set had three types of composite samples with the reinforcement weight fractions of 10, 15 and 20%. Metal matrix composites are the materials in which reinforcement materials are added to. Metal matrix composites are advanced engineered materials capable of displaying improved strength, wear and creep resistance, excellent damping and reduced thermal expansion making them suitable.

<p>Metal based composite materials, known as metal matrix composites (mmcs), are one of the major innovations in materials science and engineering since the late 19th century. Mmcs can offer a range of property enhancement over monolithic alloys. Where three or more constituent parts are present, it is called a hybrid composite. Sets up the part geometrically, gives cohesion to the material, it is usually flexible and not very resistant and transmits efforts from one fibre to another.</p>

Metal based composite materials, known as metal matrix composites (mmcs), are one of the major innovations in materials science and engineering since the late 19th century. When at least three materials are present, it is called a hybrid composite. Metal matrix composites and nanocomposites (mmcs and mmncs) are composite materials with at least two phases, one being the metallic matrix and the other being the reinforcements. 5.

<p>The common types of matrix and reinforcement materials and various manufacturing techniques such as traditional casting and powder metallurgy to modern additive manufacturing processes used in the fabrication of metal matrix composites are provided. The difference between mmcs and mmncs is the size of the reinforcements: Each set had three types of composite samples with the reinforcement weight fractions of 10, 15 and 20%.

<p>The most common type is polymer matrix composites, however, metal matrix composites, and ceramic matrix composites are also common, as are natural composites such as wood. The other material may be a different metal or another material, such as a ceramic or organic compound. For instance, polymer matrixes are more sensitive to surface flaws such as small cracks.
