Space Trash, Space Treasure 99 Invisible From 99percentinvisible.org
Much of the debris is in low earth orbit, within 2,000 km (1,200 miles) of earth’s surface, though some debris can be found in geostationary orbit 35,786 km (22,236 miles). It is estimated that hundreds of millions of pieces of space trash are now floating through our region of the solar system. Leo satellites orbit in many planes, typically up to 15 times a day. There are around one million pieces of space trash in earth’s orbit, including all of the equipment discarded by astronauts while floating in space and debris from.
