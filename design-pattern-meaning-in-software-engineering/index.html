Behavioral design patterns refer to the patterns that help to solve problems related. Secondly, design patterns are not programming language specific. Design patterns are structures tested by millions of developers over many years , so if you choose the right pattern to model the right problem, you can be sure that it will be one of the most valid solutions (if not the best) that you can find. You can’t transform a design pattern directly into code.
