reentry Why don&#39;t the hottest temperatures of a reentering From space.stackexchange.com
The orbiter is the large, white space plane where the crew lives and works. It is the only part of the shuttle that goes into orbit. Did you know that satellites and the space shuttle don&#39;t need engines to power their orbits? The space shuttle orbiter system uses very pure cryogenic hydrogen and oxygen feedstocks and has an immobilized electrolyte that cannot be regenerated without complete rebuilding of the cells.
