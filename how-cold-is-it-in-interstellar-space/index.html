How cold is interstellar space? How is this even measured? That question is sure to prompt the geeks among us to pipe up with “2.7k”. But since the interstellar medium (ism) is so dilute, a normal thermometer.

<p>Interstellar space travel is a real pain in the neck. Interstellar space is the physical space within a galaxy beyond the influence each star has upon the encompassed plasma. Interstellar space is often called the space between the stars, but more specifically, it’s the region between our sun’s heliosphere and the astrospheres of other stars. The sparse pockets of space that contain little but cosmic background radiation, leftover energy from the formation of the universe, hover in at around 2.7 kelvin.

<p>Didn't read) the average temperature of outer space near earth is 283.32 kelvins (10.17 degrees celsius or 50.3 degrees fahrenheit). How is this even measured? Scientists define the beginning of interstellar space as the place where the sun’s constant flow of material and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings. How cold is it in space?

<p>Scientists define the beginning of interstellar space as the place where the sun’s constant flow of material and magnetic field stop affecting its surroundings. But that doesn’t necessarily make it easy, and it certainly doesn’t mean we’ll achieve it in our lifetimes, let alone this century. So there is no one value for temperature that characterizes the motion of all particles in outer space. There’s no law of physics that outright forbids it.
