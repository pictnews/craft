<p>One of the main components of software design is the software requirements analysis (sra). It deals with representing the client's requirement, as described in srs (software requirement specification) document, into a form, i.e., easily implementable using programming language. Software design is a process to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation.

<p>Software design process is an important stage in sdlc (software development life cycle ) model. Ieee defines software design as ‘both a process of defining, the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component and the result of that process.’. The prototype should be every bit as good as the final. The engineering design process is typically approached in these seven steps: Process simulation as the key discipline of chemical engineering.</p>

<p>Define the problem and identify the constraints. Software design process is a process to user requirements after analysis in suitable form so that a programmer can write coding or implements it. One of the main components of software design is the software requirements analysis (sra). Once the actor and its usage scenario are defined, a command hierarchy is identified.the command hierarchy defines major system menu categories (the menu bar or tool palette) and all subfunctions that are available within the context of a major system menu category (the menu windows).

For assessing user requirements, an srs (software requirement specification) document is created whereas for coding and implementation, there is a need of more specific. That is, the design is represented at a high level of abstraction— a level that can be directly traced to the specific system objective and more. It also involves designing how these elements interact with the system, such as the different interfaces required, and how data is processed.</p>
