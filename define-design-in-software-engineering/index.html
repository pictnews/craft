Ieee defines architectural design as “the process of defining a collection of hardware and software components and their interfaces to establish the framework for the development of a computer system.”. Software design is a mechanism to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation. Or to put it another way,. The software design must be in such a way that modifications can be easily made in it.
