The composite numbers are black, while the prime numbers are red. Firstly composite materials are something that is composed of a minimum of two materials. Reinforced concrete is also a composite made from steel reinforcing bars placed inside wet concrete—which makes it, in effect, a composite of a composite. Firstly composite materials are something that is composed of a minimum of two materials.
