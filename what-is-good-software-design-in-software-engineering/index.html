Software design deals with transforming the client requirements, as described in the srs document, into a form (set of documents) that is suitable for implementation in a programming language.
Software engineering Characteristics of a good software design From youtube.com
Software engineering is a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable study and approach to the design, development, operation, and maintenance of a software system. One of the main components of software design is the software requirements analysis (sra). Software design is a process to transform user requirements into some suitable form, which helps the programmer in software coding and implementation. Ieee defines software design as ‘both a process of defining, the architecture, components, interfaces, and other characteristics of a system or component and the result of that process.’.
