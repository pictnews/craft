Software Engineering Fundamentals From slideshare.net
The fundamentals of software engineering make it so that you can change things quickly and easily without having to do too much extra work. Software engineering is a systematic engineering approach to software development. There are software applications and system engineered for numerous domains and industries, and for a tester, every testing project is a new challenge because he has to understand the client’s point of view and the domain before moving on with testing activities. Designing and maintaining software systems.
