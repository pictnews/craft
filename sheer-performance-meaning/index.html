<p>Shear strength is a material property that describes a material’s resistance against a shear load before the component fails in shear. Calculating a mini split ac’s seer rating is relatively straightforward: The shear action or sliding failure described by shear strength occurs parallel to the direction of the force acting on a plane. Better sealing means better performance sealing is another characteristic fundamental to efficient packaging operations.</p>
