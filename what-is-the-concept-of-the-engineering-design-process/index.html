However, before designing an engineering system, first as an engineering concept is developed. Though i might start with the title “the engineering design process”, it is a design process that can be applied to any problem in any industry. The goal of the engineering design process is to define and create materials and systems that are economical, reliable, and safe for humans, property, and the environment. This is just a general summary of each part of the engineering design.
