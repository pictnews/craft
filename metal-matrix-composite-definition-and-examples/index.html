Difference Between Alloy and Composite Difference Between From differencebetween.net
Firstly composite materials are something that is composed of a minimum of two materials. For example, 6061al/30v/o sicp designates a discontinuously reinforced 6061 aluminum alloy with 30 volume percent silicon carbide particulate reinforcement. A metal matrix composite (mmc) is compositea metal matrix composite (mmc) is composite material with at least two constituent parts, one being a metal. When at least three materials are present, it is called a hybrid composite.
