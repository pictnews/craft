In this type of braking system the mechanical force comes from the driver pressing on the brake pedal. Once at the wheels, the brake fluid pushes friction material against either a rotor or brake drum, depending on the type. This is more durable and lighter. Five main varieties are used on modern cars, trucks, and suvs, and they include disc brakes, drum brakes, hydraulic disc brakes, hydraulic drum brakes, and electromechanical brakes.
