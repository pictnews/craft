Wood is lightweight and strong, but. The majority of modern aircraft have cabins pressurized for flight at high altitudes. Manufacturing methods utilized can be both conventional and. Aircraft manufacturers choose to build aircraft with these materials because they are strong enough to hold up under the stresses of flight but lightweight enough to allow the aircraft to lift off the ground.

<p>When a manufacturer builds a plane, they need to make sure it can lift off the ground. For instance, the materials used depend on its ability to withstand heat and cold, the weight and strength of the material, the need for low temperatures in the liquid fuel systems, or high. The use of light materials for aircraft are very important. Early aircraft such as the wright flyer were built with wood and fabric. Aerospace materials face testing times Engineer Live.</p>
