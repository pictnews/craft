These fisheries are under multiple pressures that threaten sustainability and the equitable distribution of the benefits they provide. In addition to updating many indicators from the first fao study in 2012, the new study seeks to synthesize social and nutrition benefits and to differentiate the flow of benefits from individual fishery sectors. The closure of major fisheries in the early 1990s, following collapses in important stocks and the removal of direct subsidies, has affected. Fisheries have unintended consequences on tropical marine ecosystems.
