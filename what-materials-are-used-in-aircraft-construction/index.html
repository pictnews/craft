This latter property creates a use for this material as structural members in the vicinity of compasses. Many of the materials used in the earliest aircraft, particularly wood, were prone to sudden fracture which gave the pilot no opportunity to avoid crashing (figure 18.1). Back to School!

<p>Different aircraft require different building materials. Metal began to be used in aircraft as engineers sought to overcome challenges in strength and wind. It was used to build the fuselage of large airships and still constitutes up to 80% of current aircraft materials. Here is a rundown of some of the materials used in aircraft today.

<p>Many of the materials used in the earliest aircraft, particularly wood, were prone to sudden fracture which gave the pilot no opportunity to avoid crashing (figure 18.1). Such properties make this metal a perfect material for the manufacturing of the chassis, some aircraft skin, hinges, cables, fasteners and other parts. Aircraft can be constructed from wood, fabric, many types of metal, or even composite materials (e.g. Today, aircraft engineers value steel for its durability, hardness and resistance to high temperatures.

Early aircraft such as the wright flyer were built with wood and fabric. Carbon composite materials haven’t gained widespread use in the aviation industry just yet, but boeing’s 787 dreamliner was the first major plane to use the materials in over half of its fuselage. In addition, the purpose of an airplane goes a long way in the manufacturers’ decision to use a particular type of metal, especially the metal used in the plane’s frame and body.</p>
