<p>A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software.the term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills. It is a process for planning, creating, testing, and information system. Sdlc is the acronym for software development life cycle. You can think of it as a sequence of instructions for how to perform the computation, a mathematical specification of what the output should look like, or a range of other options.

<p>Before adopting formal design processes, developers utilized organic, ad hoc techniques (that is, programs grew in a haphazard way). But, we need to see where in the software engineering concept, these paradigms stand. A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and evaluate computer software.the term programmer is sometimes used as a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education or skills.

<p>These paradigms describe and model how software systems are developed. Software paradigms refer to the methods and steps, which are taken while designing the software. Software paradigms software paradigms refer to the methods and steps, which are taken while designing the software. In the history of software engineering, we can discern some strong ideas and movements to promote them that lead the way of thinking how to do research and practice of software engineering for a certain period of time or still retain their impact now.
