Other games with deep crafting systems? Hey, i was just watching a youtube video of dead space 3, and i really like the crafting system, however i have not yet completed the previous dead spaces, but i would love to play a game. Similar to vanguard, darkfall has an extensive and deep crafting system that allows players to create everything from armor and weapons to warhulks (siege weaponry). Released in 2013, the game is still readily available through early access.
