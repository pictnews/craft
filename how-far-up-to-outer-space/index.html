NOAA&#39;s DSCOVR Going to a &#34;Far Out&#34; Orbit NASA From nasa.gov
We often think of space as being very far away. In 1957, american aerodynamicist and founder of jpl, theodore von kármán, proposed that the altitude of 300,000 feet—57 miles— should mark the beg. For this reason, mcdowell chose 50 miles as the true lower edge of space. According to the us air force, anyone who has completed the required training and.

<p>It is estimated that the universe is approximately 13.8 billion years old. However the kármán line, at an altitude of 100 km (62 mi) above sea level, is conventionally used as the start of outer space in space treaties and for aerospace records keeping. How far is outer space. On earth, space begins at the kármán line (100 km above sea level).</p>
