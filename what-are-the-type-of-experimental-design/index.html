Let’s put these concepts in chronological order so we can better understand how an experiment runs from start to finish. Experimental design is the process of carrying out research in an objective and controlled fashion so that precision is maximized and specific conclusions can be drawn regarding a hypothesis statement. Consider your variables and how they are related. Of levels of each factor.
