Most aluminum alloy sheet stock used in aircraft construction range from 0.016 to 0.096 inch in thickness; Repair and maintenance of aircraft require strict adherence to design specifications and proper choice of materials. Such properties make this metal a perfect material for the manufacturing of the chassis, some aircraft skin, hinges, cables, fasteners and other parts.

<p>A very light metal, aluminium helps to reduce the overall weight of an aircraft. Aircraft manufacturers choose to build aircraft with these materials because they are strong enough to hold up under the stresses of flight but lightweight enough to allow the aircraft to lift off the ground. The materials used in the manufacturing of aircraft have changed significantly from the construction of the first aircraft.
