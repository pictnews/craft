Food Preservation Methods and Food Processing From slideshare.net
We can apply our knowledge and understanding of biology to make even this simple process more efficient and productive. Aquaculture (farming seafood) is the fastest growing industry in food animal production. Food manufacturing and, within it, methods used in food processing and production, can have drawbacks as well as benefits. Many of the oldest food processing techniques, such as drying fruit, pickling vegetables, salting meat, and fermenting dairy (e.g., to make cheese or yogurt) remain important to this day because they preserve food, delaying spoilage.
