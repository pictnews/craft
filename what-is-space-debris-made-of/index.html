The Space Junk Problem Is About to Get a Whole Lot Gnarlier WIRED From wired.com
Every satellite that goes into orbit has the potential of becoming space debris, professor hugh lewis, head of the astronautics. While most of it is very small, some debris is extremely large in size and can cause collisions with other satellites or rockets, which can make future space exploration and communications very. It’s commonly used to talk about manmade objects orbiting earth, although meteoroids could also be considered space debris. It also includes fragments of vehicles that exploded or collided, and debris that is shed off of satellites such as bits of insulation and paint.
