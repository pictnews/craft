Space debris includes old, inactive satellites, rocket stages, and other discarded hardware such as instrument covers or separation bolts. They offer a unique perspective, a resource for collecting scientific data, commercial opportunities. Space trash is often attracted by earth’s gravitational pull. Generally, the smaller the debris is the more abundant it is.
