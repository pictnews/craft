Eights always have a coxswain. The bow pair have a key job in an eight because, while at stroke there’s a risk of overworking by picking up too much load, in the bows the risk is to under work. Rowers in these positions must have smooth and fluid technique. The octuple is directed by a coxswain and propelled by eight rowers who move the boat by sculling with two oars, one in each hand.
