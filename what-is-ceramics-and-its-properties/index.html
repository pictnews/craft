Here is a detailed overview of the different types of clay and its From sodis-plc.com
Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in shearing and tension. The elastic modulus (young&#39;s modulus) of ceramics is usually higher than for metals, because ceramics are bonded either covalently or ionically. They have almost zero ductility. Depending on the phase, they are called monophasic.

<p>Ceramic materials can be identified by their general properties like high hardness, brittleness, chemical stability and low thermal conductivity. Chemical inertness (they’re unreactive with other chemicals). These material properties are utilized to produce number of commercial and domestic products such as pottery, bricks, advanced functional items, etc. They are good thermal and electrical insulators and possess good resistance to oxidation and corrosion.
