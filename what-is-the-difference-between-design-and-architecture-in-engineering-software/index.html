Yes, there is a difference between system architecture and system design. Unlike the name indicates, a software architect is not simply. Designs constrain implementation to achieve objectives such as consistency, reliability and security.software architecture is a plan that gives enough detail to produce a software design. Software design delves deeper into the implementation details of the system.
