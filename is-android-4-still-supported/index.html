Androidx86 announces 4.4 release candidate Android Community From androidcommunity.com
Which versions of android are still supported, and which is the most secure one? I have xperia z1 compact with 4.4. A solution has been found that ensures that users on old android devices won&#39;t face any connectivity issues later this year. A lot of android apps already require 4.0 and above, and like the author says, supporting 2.3 and below is not hard with multiple apk support and doesn&#39;t require you to drop anyone.
