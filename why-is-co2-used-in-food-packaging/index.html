It preserves food for future use, which ensures that no food goes to waste. Nitrogen is a popular gas for food packaging because it displaces oxygen. Used in every part of the process, from the production of poultry and pork products, to refrigeration units, to the transporting of food to supermarkets, co2 is one of the most important elements.
