Software engineering involves a process that deals with requirement collection, design, testing, and maintenance. Problems arise when a software generally exceeds timelines, budgets, and reduced levels of quality. Software engineering is the application of principles used in the field of engineering, which usually deals with physical systems, to the design, development, testing, deployment and management of software systems. Software design is an imperative procedure and one of the basic steps taken to develop the software in sdlc (software design life cycle).
