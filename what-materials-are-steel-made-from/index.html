<p>The blast furnace is the first step in producing steel from iron oxides. Other metals are added to the scrap to give the steel the chemical composition needed during this process. The main raw materials for steel production in a blast furnace are iron ore, limestone, coke, and some scrap steel. For efficient heat transfusion in the blast furnace, iron and coal must be solidified from their powder form. Raw Materials Stainless Steel Cookware Manufacturer GUANHUA.</p>

<p>The type of steel achieved at the end of the steel making process depends upon both the different types of metals that have been melted together to form the final product and how these. The temperature and time this takes will depend on the material, but the end product of molten metal is the. Since iron is brittle and not easily formable it has to be turned into steel in a second step. These materials are charged into the blast furnace from the top and converts into molten pig iron.
