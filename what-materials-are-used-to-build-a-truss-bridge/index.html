<p>The difference between a truss bridge and a beam bridge is its triangular shapes which help to support more weight on the bridge. To build the trusses pieces of wood will be cut. Stones, timber, concrete, and steel are some of the classic materials used in bridge construction. Steelâ€™s versatility allows it to be used as a primary member or in safety components.

<p>Stones, timber, concrete and steel are the traditional materials that are used to carry out bridge construction. I remember my bridge was around 2.5. However, the most commonly used materials include concrete, steel, stone, and composite material. Given that a triangle cannot be distorted by stress, a truss gives a stable form capable of supporting considerable external loads over a large span.

<p>What makes truss bridges relevant more today than ever is their effective use of materials. During the initial period, timber and stones were used in the construction, as they are directly obtained from nature and easily available. Other materials include iron, timber, aluminum, rubber and other joint materials. Timber and stones were employed in the construction at first since they are directly sourced from nature and are readily available.
