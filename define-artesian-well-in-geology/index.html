Artesian Well From geo.mtu.edu
The level to which water will rise in tightly cased wells in artesian aquifers is called the potentiometric surface. What’s unique about the other 2 wells is they are both labeled artesian wells. Essentially water can not penetrate all rock so gravity and rock density determine the path. Although this is an interesting geological situation, artesian water has.

<p>Artesian water is water produced from an artesian well. The difference is one is known as simply an ‘artesian well’ and the other is known as a ‘flowing artesian. This occurs when there is enough pressure in the aquifer. Meanwhile, the flowing artesian well is a type of well that has been drilled into an aquifer. Groundwater Confined or artesian groundwater.</p>

The word artesian comes from the town of artois in france, the old roman city of artesium, where the best known flowing artesian wells were drilled in the middle ages.

<p>The word artesian comes from the town of artois in france, the old roman city of artesium, where the best known flowing artesian wells were drilled in the middle ages. To be an artesian well, the water in the aquifer (a subsurface rock unit that holds and transmits water) must be under enough pressure to force it up the well to a level that is higher than the top of the aquifer. When the well is excavated in the confined aquifer, and the water in the well reach over the water table but not on the surface of the earth. It does not require a pump to bring the water to the surface, but rather relies on the pressure in the aquifer to force water to the surface. 14.2 Groundwater Flow Physical Geology.</p>

The geologic conditions necessary for an artesian well are an inclined. Artesian conditions are common when the aquifer has a synclinal form.

This phenomenon is due to the pressurising of an aquifer when the slope of the impermeable geological layer above it forces it under its piezometric line (line of equal pressure in subterranean water).
