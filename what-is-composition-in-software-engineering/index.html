<p>Luckily there are open source and commercial specialized software around this topic. In the literary sense, a composition (from the latin to put together) is the way a writer assembles words and sentences to create a coherent and meaningful work. Software composition analysis (sca) having hundreds or thousands of dependencies in the codebase to investigate is certainly an unfeasible task to manually pursue, thus a higher degree of automation is required. • “software engineering, ian sommerville, 9th ed., 2012.
