It uses scalmalloy, a new type of alloy called specially developed for 3d printing by airbus subsidiary apworks. Most aircraft engines are either piston engines or gas turbines, although a few have been rocket powered and in recent years many small uavs have used electric motors. Today, stainless steel is commonly used in airframes—the body of an aircraft—since the materials used here need to withstand extreme hot and cold temperatures as well as corrosives.
