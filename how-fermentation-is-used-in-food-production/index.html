Fermentation was primarily developed for the stabilization of perishable agricultural produce. 10 reasons why is fermentation important to human: This technique was pioneered in 1978, when the first recombinant insulin was produced by inserting its genetic code into a bacteria. More broadly, fermentation is the foaming that occurs during the manufacture of wine and beer, a process at least 10,000 years old.
