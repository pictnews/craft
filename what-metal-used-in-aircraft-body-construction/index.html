Aircraft construction demands materials that are both durable and lightweight, as well as being able to withstand severe pressure at high altitudes, and exposure to the elements. A very light metal, aluminium helps to reduce the overall weight of an aircraft. Those who have professional expertise in the airline industry know the very important role structural metals play in the construction of aircraft, particularly in the construction of airframes. It’s strong, lightweight, predictable and inexpensive.

<p>Mostly aluminium alloys, but some aircraft have used steel, titanium and more recently. Well, the list goes on and on. Aluminum is the perfect material to use when manufacturing airplanes, thanks in part to its unique properties and characteristics. Some polymers are tough and transparent which makes them suitable for aircraft windows and canopies.</p>

<p>Being a reputed steel manufacturer in india, we are glad to be. The most common metals used in aircraft construction are aluminum, magnesium, titanium, steel, and their alloys. Copper, aluminium, nickel, titanium and stainless steel are used in different applications. Aircraft manufacturers choose to build aircraft with these materials because they are strong enough to hold up under the stresses of flight but lightweight enough to allow the aircraft to lift off the ground.
