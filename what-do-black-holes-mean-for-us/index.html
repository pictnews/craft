BLACK HOLES From slideshare.net
Black holes do not go around in space eating stars, moons and planets. If something falls into a black hole, it can never come back out. It swallows up everything too close, too slow or too small to fight its gravitational force. Black holes are the dark remnants of collapsed stars, regions of space cut off from the rest of the universe.
