Disadvantages of Composites From phase-trans.msm.cam.ac.uk
Advantages * high resistance to fatigue and corrosion degradation. Since most composites generally have 60% of the density of aluminum, they weigh much less for the same amount of area. In addition to such benefits, such materials are also very accommodating in terms of manufacture, and can be formed in either simple or complicated shapes. Composite materials are composed of several different materials.

<p>When they are combined they create a material which is specialised to do a certain job, for instance to become stronger, lighter or resistant to electricity. Disadvantages of dental composites one of the disadvantages of composite teeth is that some people become allergic after the dentist places the composite. Some types of composites are used to fill teeth that. The greatest advantage that composite materials enjoy is how little they weigh. eOceanic Understanding composites for larger boat projects.</p>
