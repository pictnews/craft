<p>Clustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. This is also known as exclusive clustering. There are two major types of clustering techniques. Dissimilar records to be assigned to different groups.</p>

<p>Clustering can be divided into different categories based on different criteria • 1.hard clustering: Each approach is best suited to a particular data distribution. While doing cluster analysis, we first partition the set of data into groups based on data similarity and then assign the labels to the groups. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning and is a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many ﬁelds. Types of Clustering 5 Awesome Types of Clustering You Should Know.</p>
