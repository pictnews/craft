<p>However, the interstellar and solar wind plasmas cannot interpenetrate one another because of the magnetic fields embedded. Interstellar space is filled with a dilute gas of neutral and ionized particles and is threaded by a weak magnetic field. From the ground space dust is observed as scattered sun light from myriads of interplanetary dust particles and as meteoroids entering the atmosphere.by observing a meteor from several positions on the ground the trajectory and the entry speed can be determined by triangulation.atmospheric entry speeds of up to 72,000 m/s have been observed for leonid. Interplanetary space is defined by the solar wind, a continuous stream of charged particles emanating from the sun that creates a very tenuous atmosphere (the heliosphere) for billions of kilometers into space.
