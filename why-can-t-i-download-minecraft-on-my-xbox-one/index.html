<p>Recently got back into minecraft after it became available via gamepass. I looked at the bedrock edition version history and it appears the xbox one never got the 1.16.10 update. Now we can't even do legit things like download backgrounds and custom gamerpics. When i tried to download it, it just says “downloads are not supported on this device.” this is weird since i have downloaded multiple maps and addons.
