<p>The spark plug might be defective. Regular maintenance practices of the start system will ensure you do not run into start problems. Gasoline can get old and lose the ability to spark, so starting fluid makes starting up your chainsaw a much easier process. Over time, some of the ingredients in the fuel may evaporate, leaving behind a thicker, stickier substance.</p>
