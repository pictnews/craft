Frontiers Bacteriophages as Weapons Against Bacterial Biofilms in the From journal.frontiersin.org
Certain bacteria, including lactic acid bacteria, are used to produce yogurt, cheese, and pickles. The most common usage for bacteria in food preparation is with dairy fermentations. They play an efficient role in food production. Different microorganisms are added to specific stages of food production to produce the desired effect.

<p>Most common food like dosa and idli are prepared from fermentation of rice done by some bacteria. Within the firmicutes are the lactic acid bacteria, a cluster of grampositive bacteria that are the main organisms used in the manufacture of fermented foods. In fact, bacteria helps in the production of all the produce, cereals, etc., by keeping the soil enriched with nutrients.a specific example of this is seen with legumes (including lentils, peas, beans, soybeans, etc.) which are common protein rich food.
