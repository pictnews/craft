What causes Space Debris? ProProfs Discuss From proprofsdiscuss.com
Add an even larger number of smaller pieces, and one gets a total debris density of 7 million kilos. Fortunately for astronauts, most space. Debris in space is called space junk or orbital debris because they orbit the earth. The space junk pollute the earth.

<p>Discarded satellites make up a lot of the space junk around earth, as well as debris from aerospace vehicles discarded during their descent. Simply put, roughly 70 years of space exploration. From that point onward, nasa, roscosmos (the russian space agency), and every federal space agency that followed has been launching satellites into spac. Spent rocket stages and separation bolts also contribute to the debris circling around earth. Space junk Even small fragments have the potential to cause.</p>
