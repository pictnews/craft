Definition of the horizontal shear force in the RC beamcolumn From researchgate.net
Shear force is measured in newtons. Thus, a shear force diagram is a graphical plot, which depicts how the internal shear force f&#39; varies along the length of beam. This resultant internal force keeps the beam/body in equilibrium (i.e, applied force on beam is equal to the internal shear forces in. To cut off the hair from;

Shear force or shearing forces can be defined as a force that acts on a body/material (commonly seen in beam designs) where the force acts in one direction, and an internal force acts in the opposite direction. Its force times the area of shear. Shear stress is defined as the component of stress that acts parallel to a material cross section.
