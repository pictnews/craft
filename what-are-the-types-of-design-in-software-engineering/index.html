<p>Through all development stages (analysis, design, coding, testing, deployment), the process moves in a cascade mode. Some of them overlap and can be found in a single professional, while others require a distinct skill set. The deployment level design element shows the software functionality and subsystem that allocated in the physical computing environment which support the software. The design process involves developing a conceptual view of the system, establishing system structure, identifying data streams and data stores, decomposing high level functions into sub functions, establishing relationships and interconnections among components, developing concrete data representations, and specifying algorithmic details.</p>

There are 5 different types of design classes that represent a different layer of design architecture that can be developed: The design process involves developing a conceptual view of the system, establishing system structure, identifying data streams and data stores, decomposing high level functions into sub functions, establishing relationships and interconnections among components, developing concrete data representations, and specifying algorithmic details.
