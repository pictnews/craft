Of the many processes involved in the water cycle, the most important are evaporation, transpiration, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. The water cycle refers to the cycle that describes the continuous movement of water on, above, and below the surface of the earth. In simple words, this cycle describes how water evaporates from the earth’s surface, emerges into the atmosphere, cools down, and by condensation becomes rain or snow in clouds, and falls again to the earth’s.
