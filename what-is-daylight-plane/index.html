<p>General aviation planes use nav lights mostly at night and in bad weather. Where, ei = illuminance due to daylight at a point on the indoors working plane, eo = simultaneous outdoor illuminance on a horizontal plane from an unobstructed hemisphere of overcast sky. Ultralights can be powered or unpowered. Aircraft position lights are required to be lighted on aircraft operated on the surface and in flight from sunset to sunrise.

<p>However, no comment on the team that came up with daylight plane or character overlay for a home and a residential neighborhood. In architecture, a daylight factor (df) is the ratio of the light level inside a structure to the light level outside the structure. The daylight in injection molding machine is space or distance between fixed platen and moving platen during open and close clamping on a injection molding machine. Daylight factor is typically calculated by dividing the horizontal work plane illumination indoors by the horizontal illumination on the roof of the building being tested and then multiplying by 100.
