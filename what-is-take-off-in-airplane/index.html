<p>V1 is actually a speed. Take off performance can be predicted using a simple measure of the acceleration of the aircraft along the runway based on force equilibrium. However, for this article, we will consider only the situation where the airplane will be taking off at an airport with an operating control tower. This causes a lot of engine wear, so most of the time aricraft calculate the minimim thrust needed for an efficient takeoff. Airplane ready to take off wallpaper 2880x1800 3830 WallpaperUP.</p>
