Subspace clustering is an unsupervised learning problem that aims at grouping data points into multiple clusters so. There is no chance of loss of data from any node in a hadoop cluster. In hierarchical cluster analysis methods, a cluster is initially formed and then included in another cluster which is quite similar to the cluster which is formed to form one single cluster. The types of clusters are:

A cluster is a set of objects such that an object in a cluster is closer (more similar) to the âcenterâ of a cluster, than to the center of any other cluster. In all three types, you first divide the population into clusters, then randomly select clusters for use in your sample. Clustering Types Example.</p>

Suppose that a data set to be clustered contains n objects, which may represent persons, houses, documents, countries, and so on.
